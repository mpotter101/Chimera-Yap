Dev Log:

Feb 11 2026
    Refined the layout pretty significantly. Starting to feel like a real app.
    Got a design hammered out for Chatty the Chimera.
    Still have some elements to knock out.
    Started listing out features that can wait as a way to get them off of the mental stack and keep the scope down.

Work Items
    [x] Figure out an easy way to implement a WYSIWYG editor
        > cancelling this. Following a more discord-like way of adding media as it is easier.
    [ ] Design the various friend states for friends that are online/offline and have an unread message
    [ ] Design state for telegraphing the chatroom you are currently inspiration
        > Both highlighting the selected chat room and a redudant set of info either in the header bar or somewhere similar.
    [ ] Draw some simple profile icons for: Fighter, Healer, and Thief
    [ ] make tiny icons for each of the heads on Chatty the Chimera to be used in a "so-and-so is yapping" animation for displaying to other users who is typing. 
    [ ] Fix styling issue with profile widget when window becomes too thin

    Created a basic layout with fixed content to get an idea of flow and feel.
    I feel like the current design does a good job of working at a half-ratio for a 1080 desktop display.
    Really wanting to hammer out the presentation before anything else.

    Looking at PC-98 Rpgs for UI inspiration.
